# XFM2GUI

## ABOUT
This project focuses on creating a JavaFX based GUI for interacting with the [futur3soundz XFM2 Synthesizer Module](https://futur3soundz.com). The application was made in part submission towards my MSc dissertation project. The idea behind the project comes from the XFM2 synthesizer module not currently having a 
cross-platform application for interacting with it, instead relying on terminal interaction (or an Excel spreadsheet on Windows platforms).

## FEATURES
- Change parameters of the XFM2 board
- Save and Load local patch files (saved as .xfm2 files)
- Automatic detection of XFM2 device on program load
- Usable on Windows, Mac and Linux

## FUTURE FEATURES
- Write Tuning, Bank and Program files to the XFM2
- Back compatibility with the gen 1 XFM device (and potential compatibility with the XVA)

## THIRD-PARTY CODE
