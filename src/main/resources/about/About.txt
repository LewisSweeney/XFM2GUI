This application has been developed as part of my MSc dissertation. The app is intended for use with the XFM2 synthesizer module created by futur3soundz.
The aim of the project was to create a platform independent application to program the device using its USB-over-serial capabilities.

The application can change all of the parameters and patches of your XFM2 device, as well as save and load programs locally.
Unfortunately, the device will still need access to a windows machine to install the initial program.

If you're seeing this text, I'd like to thank you for downloading this app and I hope it's been useful to you
